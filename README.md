# Better Rest

This app helps you find your perfect bedtime considering the desired amount of
sleep, and the amount of coffee consumed during the day.

To do the calculation we use a CoreML Tabular Regressor model.

This is the project 3 of the SwiftUI edition
of [hackingwithswift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com).

## Setup

This app has no external dependencies, just build and run `BetterRest.xcodeproj`
from Xcode.
