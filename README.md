# Better Rest

This app helps you find your perfect bedtime considering the desired amount of
sleep, and the amount of coffee consumed during the day.

To do the estimation it uses a CoreML Tabular Regressor model.

Project 4 of the SwiftUI edition
of [hackingwithswift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com).

## Setup

This app has no external dependencies, just build and run `BetterRest.xcodeproj`
from Xcode.
